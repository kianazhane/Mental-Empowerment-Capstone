# Mental-Empowerment-Capstone

HTML, CSS, JavaScript, IndexedDB, Custom Component

A website designed to provide resources to CareGivers of individuals in marginalized communities struggling with mental health challenges. 

Mental Empowerment (ME) for Caregivers bypasses the perceived stigma and shame associated with mental illness and directly focuses on ways to find help. 

Three key features:
	1. 24/7 Crisis Hotline The 24/7 Crisis Hotline is available on every page so users are able to dial in when they’re most in need of help. 

	2. Resources tab, will have different articles for caregivers to refer to in their time of need. These articles will showcase different diagnosis’ and situations pertaining to a specific caregiver’s situation.  

	3. Motivational Quotes tab, we intended on having multiple motivational quotes display as you click on “New Quote” for caregivers when they are in need of an extra boost. However, we did run into some issues finding a good API to use for the motivational quotes - so this one includes quotes from Anime shows. Users are also able to add quotes to their favorites and be able to view them from a favorites page.

Future goal - Segmentation to address each cultural segment in the marginalized community:	
	1. Dedicated page for each cultural segment.
		a. “Cheat Sheet” / “Where To Start” pages.
		b.	Therapist, doctors, shelters
	2. API 
	Curate information and build API’s specific to the cultural segments. (We could not find any when planning.

This website utilizes storing data in the IndexedDB. When viewing the Motivational Quotes tab, users are able to cycle through quotes that they like the best and save it as a favorite. They are then able to view all of their favorite quotes on a separate Favorites page.

A custom component was also used for our header and footer of each of the HTML pages.
