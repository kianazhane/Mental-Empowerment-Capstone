        <h1>What Do We Do?</h1>
        <p>
            Many people find themselves in a situation where they're unsure of what to do or where to go.
            Do any of the following sound familiar?<br>
            <div class="familiar">
                <li>My son, a black male, just snapped. Who do I call?</li>

                <li>I am scared to call the police. If I call the police, what do I say so they don’t come in unaware of our situation?
                    Is there anybody else to call besides the police?</li>
                
                <li>My child is an adult, and I know they are not in their right state of mind, but they won’t sign a release form. How do I get information?</li>
                
                <li>My adult child doesn’t have insurance or they have insurance that doesn’t cover the type of care they needs. What resources are there to help me with out of pocket costs?</li>
                
                <li>My adult child has run away. How can I get around the 48 hour missing person rule?</li>
                
                <li>I don’t believe my loved one is sick.</li>
                
                <li>My loved one has Alzheimer’s. My family does not believe in putting a family member in a home, but I have primary responsibility. What should I do?</li>
                
                <li>"Going to a therapist is for ‘weak’ people who can’t handle things on their own."  So how do I make my child stronger?</li>
                
                <li>How can I go about gaining legal guardianship for my adult child?</li>
